# CNNs for Text Classification

**Overview:**
This repository delves into the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for text classification tasks. CNNs excel at capturing local patterns within text data, making them well-suited for tasks like sentiment analysis, topic classification, and spam detection. This project guides you through building a CNN-based text classifier, explaining each step from data preparation to model training and interpretation.

**Set Up:**

1. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have essential libraries like `torch`, `torchtext`, and `numpy` installed using `pip install torch torchtext numpy`.

**Load Data:**

1. **Load Text Data:** Load your pre-processed text data from a suitable format (e.g., CSV, JSON). The data should consist of text samples along with corresponding labels.

**Preprocessing:**

1. **Text Cleaning:** Clean the text data (e.g., lowercase conversion, punctuation removal) to ensure consistency and improve model performance.

**Split Data:**

1. **Train/Test Split:** Divide your data into training and testing sets using techniques like random splitting or stratified splitting (if your classes are imbalanced). This allows the model to learn from the training data and be evaluated on unseen data in the testing set.

**Label Encoding:**

1. **Convert Labels:** If your labels are categorical (e.g., "positive", "negative"), convert them to numerical representations (e.g., 1, 0) for compatibility with the model.

**Tokenizer:**

1. **Tokenization:** Break down the text into meaningful units like words or subwords using a tokenizer (e.g., `nltk.word_tokenize` or spaCy).

**Padding:**

1. **Uniform Length:** Pad shorter sequences with a special token (e.g., `<pad>`) to create a uniform input length for the CNN. This is essential because CNNs operate on fixed-size inputs.

**Dataset Creation:**

1. **PyTorch Dataset:** Create PyTorch datasets for training and testing data. These datasets efficiently manage data loading and batching during training.

**CNN Architecture:**

The CNN architecture is the core of your text classifier. Here's a breakdown of key components:

* **Inputs:** The input layer accepts the padded text sequences, represented as numerical vectors.
* **Filters:** Convolutional filters slide across the sequence, capturing local patterns. Multiple filters with different sizes can be used to learn diverse features.
* **Pooling:** Pooling layers (e.g., max pooling) downsample the output of the convolutional layers, reducing dimensionality and capturing the most significant features.
* **Batch Normalization (Optional):** Batch normalization can be added after convolutional layers to improve model stability and convergence during training.

**Model Definition:**

1. **Define Model:** Use PyTorch's `nn` module to define your CNN model, incorporating layers like `Conv1d`, `MaxPool1d`, and `Flatten` to process the text data and extract relevant features.
2. **Activation Functions:** Employ activation functions (e.g., ReLU) after convolutional layers to introduce non-linearity and improve model learning capacity.
3. **Output Layer:** The final layer depends on the classification task:
    * **Multi-class Classification:** Use a fully connected layer with a softmax activation to output probabilities for each class.
    * **Binary Classification:** Use a single output neuron with a sigmoid activation to predict the class probability.

**Training:**

1. **Optimizer:** Choose an optimizer (e.g., Adam) to update model weights during training based on the calculated loss.
2. **Loss Function:** Select a loss function (e.g., cross-entropy loss for classification) to quantify the difference between the model's predictions and the true labels.
3. **Training Loop:** Implement a training loop that iterates through the training data, calculates loss, updates model weights using the optimizer, and monitors training progress (e.g., accuracy on the training set).

**Evaluation:**

1. **Evaluate Model:** Evaluate the model's performance on the unseen testing set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This provides an unbiased assessment of how well the model generalizes to new data.

**Inference:**

1. **Predict on New Data:** Once trained, use your model to make predictions on entirely new text data. This allows you to apply your model to real-world classification tasks.

**Interpretability (Optional):**

1. **Understanding Predictions:** Explore techniques like visualizing attention weights or using gradient-based methods to gain insights into how the CNN model arrives at its predictions. This can be particularly valuable for debugging and understanding model behavior.

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Experiment with different hyperparameters (e.g., number of filters, filter sizes, learning rate) to optimize model performance.
* **Regularization:** Techniques like dropout can help prevent overfitting and improve model generalization.
* **Advanced Architectures:** Explore more sophisticated CNN architectures like residual connections or inception modules for potentially better performance.
